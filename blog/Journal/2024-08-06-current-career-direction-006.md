## Current Job Search Status

- Landed an overseas sales job in Changwon with an equal salary to last dev role

- Going into Data Science without a Master's degree seems daunting to say the least

- Overall dev market is not great either

- Current strategy is to polish projects, do hackathons, and maybe finish my bachelor's
