As of today I have 2 years and 2 months of web development experience, and 7 months of ML experience.

And although Changwon is a very affordable city with all the amenities to keep me and my fiance happy, good jobs seem to be nearly impossible to come by.

My current best plan of action is to move to Seoul and work for a decent company that requires a ML engineer, but with my wedding coming up and my fiance requiring an F4 visa for Korea,
Staying put in Changwon until the end of 2023 seems best.

Keeping sharp and ready for new job opportunities is always the best approach so my profiles on various job portals have been made current, Saramin, JobKorea, RocketPunch. And my resume has been updated.2

Unfortunately, I cannot display my best work as they are company projects, but I am still attempting to salvage as much as I can for my portfolio without violating company policy.

Personal projects are unfortunately in a very sorry state and need much more work to be done on them.2

I am keeping my spirits up at least as every day I spend at my company is more experience in my career.
