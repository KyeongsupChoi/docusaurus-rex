**Imbalanced Dataset**: An imbalanced dataset refers to a dataset in which the distribution of class labels is not uniform. That is, the number of samples in each class is disproportionate, with one or more classes being significantly more prevalent than others.

**Accuracy**: Accuracy is a measure of the correctness of the model's predictions. It is calculated as the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions made.

**Precision and Recall**: Precision is the ratio of true positive predictions to the total number of positive predictions made by the model. Recall, also known as sensitivity, is the ratio of true positive predictions to the total number of actual positive instances in the dataset.

**F1-score**: The F1-score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. It provides a balance between precision and recall and is calculated as 2 * (precision * recall) / (precision + recall).

**AU-ROC (Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve)**: AU-ROC is a performance metric used for binary classification models. It represents the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, which plots the true positive rate against the false positive rate at various threshold settings.

**Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: MAE is a measure of the average absolute errors between the predicted and actual values. It is calculated as the average of the absolute differences between predicted and actual values.

**Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: MSE is a measure of the average of the squares of the errors between the predicted and actual values. It penalizes large errors more than smaller ones and is calculated as the average of the squared differences between predicted and actual values.

**Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**: RMSE is the square root of the mean squared error. It represents the standard deviation of the errors between the predicted and actual values.

**R² (R-Squared)**: R² is a statistical measure that represents the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is explained by the independent variables in a regression model. It ranges from 0 to 1 and higher values indicate a better fit of the model to the data.
