## 1. Beginner

### Skills:
- Basic understanding of server-side programming languages (e.g., Python, Node.js, Java, Ruby).
- Familiarity with HTTP protocols, request/response cycles, and basic client-server architecture.
- Ability to set up a simple server using frameworks like Flask, Express, or Django.
- Basic understanding of databases (SQL or NoSQL) and how to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
- Awareness of RESTful API concepts and how to create simple endpoints.

### Example Tasks:
- Setting up a simple web server that responds to HTTP requests.
- Writing API endpoints that interact with a database.
- Implementing basic user authentication and handling form data.

---

## 2. Intermediate

### Skills:
- Proficient in designing and implementing RESTful APIs with CRUD functionality.
- Understanding of relational databases (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) and NoSQL databases (e.g., MongoDB, Redis), including schema design, relationships, and indexing.
- Familiar with middleware, routing, and handling file uploads.
- Knowledge of authentication methods like OAuth, JWT, and sessions.
- Experience with version control systems (e.g., Git) and basic knowledge of continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD).

### Example Tasks:
- Developing an API for user management (e.g., authentication, authorization).
- Designing a relational database schema and optimizing queries.
- Setting up middleware for logging, error handling, and security in a web application.
- Connecting your backend with external services via APIs (e.g., payment gateways, third-party APIs).

---

## 3. Advanced

### Skills:
- Expertise in building scalable and secure APIs, including complex query optimization, advanced authentication/authorization (e.g., SSO, RBAC).
- Knowledge of microservices architecture and ability to design and develop microservices-based applications.
- Proficient in using messaging queues (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka) for asynchronous processing and communication.
- Experience with cloud infrastructure (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud, Azure), containerization (Docker), and orchestration tools (Kubernetes).
- Understanding of caching strategies, load balancing, and scaling backend systems to handle high traffic.

### Example Tasks:
- Designing and deploying a microservices-based architecture with services that communicate asynchronously.
- Setting up continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines for automated testing and deployment.
- Implementing caching strategies (e.g., Redis, Memcached) to optimize API performance.
- Designing highly available and scalable systems using cloud services and containerization.

## 4. Expert

### Skills:
- Mastery of distributed systems, including managing data consistency, eventual consistency, and CAP theorem implications.
- Expertise in backend architecture patterns (e.g., event-driven architecture, CQRS, serverless) for complex and high-traffic systems.
- Deep knowledge of security best practices, including encryption, secure communication, and data protection in large-scale applications.
- Extensive experience with database replication, sharding, and high availability setups.
- Ability to lead backend development teams, perform code reviews, and ensure code quality standards.
- Familiarity with DevOps tools and practices, including Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and full automation of deployment pipelines.

### Example Tasks:
- Architecting large-scale distributed systems with fault-tolerant and highly available components.
- Implementing advanced security mechanisms like end-to-end encryption and secure API gateways.
- Leading a backend development team, defining project architecture, and overseeing codebase and deployment strategies.
- Optimizing backend services to handle millions of users or high-volume real-time data streams.
