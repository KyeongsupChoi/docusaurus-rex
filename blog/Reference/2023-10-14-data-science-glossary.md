Data Science:

The interdisciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms, and systems to extract insights and knowledge from structured and unstructured data.
Data:

Raw facts and figures that can be processed to obtain information.
Dataset:

A collection of data, often organized in a tabular format, used for analysis.
Feature:

An individual measurable property or characteristic of a phenomenon being observed, often represented as columns in a dataset.
Algorithm:

A set of rules or procedures followed by a computer to solve a problem or perform a task.
Machine Learning:

A subset of artificial intelligence that involves the development of algorithms that enable computers to learn patterns from data and make predictions or decisions without explicit programming.
Model:

A representation of a system or process used to make predictions or understand patterns in data.
Supervised Learning:

A type of machine learning where the algorithm is trained on a labeled dataset, with input-output pairs, to learn the mapping between inputs and outputs.
Unsupervised Learning:

A type of machine learning where the algorithm is given unlabeled data and must find patterns or relationships within the data on its own.
Regression:

A type of predictive modeling that estimates relationships among variables. It predicts a continuous outcome.
Classification:

A type of predictive modeling that assigns labels to input data based on its characteristics. It predicts a categorical outcome.
Clustering:

A technique in unsupervised learning where similar data points are grouped together into clusters.
Overfitting:

When a model learns the training data too well, including noise, and performs poorly on new, unseen data.
Underfitting:

When a model is too simple to capture the underlying patterns in the training data and performs poorly on both training and new data.
Feature Engineering:

The process of selecting, transforming, or creating new features to improve the performance of a machine learning model.
Bias:

Systematic errors introduced by a model that consistently skews predictions in a particular direction.
Variance:

The variability of model predictions for a given input, indicating how sensitive the model is to changes in the training data.
Cross-Validation:

A technique used to assess a model's performance by splitting the data into multiple subsets for training and testing.
Big Data:

Extremely large and complex datasets that traditional data processing applications are inadequate to handle.
Data Visualization:

The presentation of data in graphical or visual format to facilitate understanding and interpretation.
