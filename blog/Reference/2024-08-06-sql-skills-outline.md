1. Beginner
Skills:

Understanding basic SQL syntax and queries.
Ability to create simple queries to retrieve data using SELECT, WHERE, and ORDER BY clauses.
Familiarity with basic data operations like INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE.
Basic knowledge of filtering data with operators like =, >, <, LIKE, and IN.
Example Tasks:

Writing a query to select data from a table based on specific conditions.
Sorting and filtering results using ORDER BY and WHERE.
Inserting new rows into a table.
2. Intermediate
Skills:

Proficiency with JOIN operations (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL OUTER) to combine data from multiple tables.
Ability to group and aggregate data using GROUP BY and aggregate functions (COUNT, SUM, AVG, MAX, MIN).
Understanding of subqueries and nested queries.
Knowledge of database constraints (e.g., primary keys, foreign keys, unique constraints) and indexes.
Experience with database normalization and designing relational database schemas.
Example Tasks:

Joining multiple tables to retrieve related data.
Writing queries to summarize data using group functions like COUNT or SUM.
Creating database tables and defining relationships between them.
3. Advanced
Skills:

Advanced query optimization techniques to improve query performance (e.g., indexing, query plans).
Ability to write complex stored procedures, functions, and triggers.
Proficiency in advanced SQL features like WITH (CTE, Common Table Expressions) and window functions (e.g., ROW_NUMBER(), RANK()).
Knowledge of database transactions, ACID properties, and handling concurrency and isolation levels.
Proficient in database security, user roles, and permissions management.
Example Tasks:

Writing stored procedures and complex triggers to automate database operations.
Optimizing slow queries by analyzing query plans and using appropriate indexing.
Implementing transaction-safe SQL queries and managing concurrency.
4. Expert
Skills:

Deep understanding of database architecture and internals (e.g., how indexes work, locking mechanisms, execution plans).
Expertise in database design, partitioning strategies, and sharding for large-scale systems.
Proficiency in advanced optimization techniques and tuning complex queries for performance.
Ability to manage and configure database replication, backup, recovery, and high availability setups.
Familiar with various database technologies (e.g., relational vs. NoSQL) and how to use SQL in different environments (e.g., cloud databases).
Example Tasks:

Designing and implementing highly scalable database architectures for enterprise applications.
Performing complex query optimization and database tuning for high-performance systems.
Configuring and maintaining database clusters and replication systems.
