1. Beginner
Skills:

Basic understanding of statistics and data analysis.
Familiarity with spreadsheets or basic data manipulation tools (e.g., Excel).
Ability to use simple data visualization tools (e.g., Excel, Google Sheets, or Python’s matplotlib and seaborn).
Introductory knowledge of programming (Python or R) and basic libraries (e.g., Pandas, NumPy).
Basic knowledge of data types (structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data).
Example Tasks:

Plotting simple graphs (bar charts, line graphs) to visualize data.
Calculating mean, median, mode, variance, and other basic statistical metrics.
Loading and cleaning small datasets.
2. Intermediate
Skills:

Proficient in data wrangling: loading, cleaning, and transforming data using libraries like Pandas, NumPy, or R’s dplyr.
Good understanding of probability, statistical testing (e.g., hypothesis testing, confidence intervals), and distributions.
Basic knowledge of machine learning algorithms (e.g., linear regression, decision trees) and their applications.
Experience with data visualization libraries (e.g., matplotlib, seaborn, or ggplot2).
Ability to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and extract insights from datasets.
Familiar with supervised and unsupervised learning concepts.
Example Tasks:

Cleaning and transforming large datasets using Pandas or NumPy.
Creating visualizations for data distributions and relationships (scatter plots, histograms).
Implementing and evaluating simple machine learning models like linear regression or K-means clustering.
Performing A/B testing or statistical analysis on datasets.
3. Advanced
Skills:

Proficient in implementing complex machine learning algorithms (e.g., random forests, gradient boosting, neural networks) using libraries like scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch.
Strong understanding of feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, model evaluation, and optimization techniques.
Experience working with large-scale datasets and using cloud platforms for data storage and computation (e.g., AWS, GCP, Azure).
Familiarity with big data tools and frameworks (e.g., Hadoop, Spark).
Ability to work with databases (SQL) and unstructured data (e.g., text data with NLP).
Knowledge of deep learning and more advanced topics like natural language processing (NLP), reinforcement learning, or computer vision.
Example Tasks:

Building and fine-tuning machine learning models for production.
Performing sentiment analysis on text data using NLP techniques.
Creating predictive models using time series analysis or deep learning methods.
Implementing machine learning pipelines for automated model training and deployment.
4. Expert
Skills:

Mastery of complex algorithms and advanced techniques, such as deep learning architectures (e.g., CNNs, RNNs, Transformers) or reinforcement learning.
Deep understanding of data science workflows, MLOps (machine learning operations), and the deployment of machine learning models in production environments.
Expertise in using cloud platforms, distributed computing, and handling real-time data streams.
Strong ability to create custom machine learning models, handle imbalanced data, and apply transfer learning.
Leadership experience in designing large-scale data science projects, mentoring teams, and making data-driven business decisions.
Example Tasks:

Designing and implementing custom deep learning architectures for complex problems (e.g., image recognition, natural language understanding).
Leading a team of data scientists in building scalable and efficient data pipelines.
Managing and deploying machine learning models at scale for real-time or high-impact applications.
Developing and deploying end-to-end AI systems and integrating them with business operations.
