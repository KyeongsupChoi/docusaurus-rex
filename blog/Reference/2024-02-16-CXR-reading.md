**Closed-line method:** In radiology, the closed-line method refers to a technique used in image interpretation, particularly in the evaluation of contrast-enhanced studies such as angiography or perfusion imaging. It involves tracing or outlining regions of interest on the image to define boundaries or contours. These outlines form closed shapes or lines around structures of interest, aiding in the quantitative analysis of parameters such as blood flow, vascular density, or tissue perfusion.

**Heat map method:** In radiology, the heat map method can be applied to visualize and analyze patterns of intensity or distribution within medical images. For example, in functional imaging modalities like positron emission tomography (PET) or functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), heat maps can be generated to represent areas of increased or decreased metabolic activity, neural activation, or tissue perfusion. These heat maps use color gradients to depict varying levels of activity or intensity, providing valuable insights into physiological or pathological processes.

**Combined method:** The combined method in radiology involves integrating multiple imaging techniques or modalities to enhance diagnostic accuracy or information content. For instance, in oncology, combining anatomical imaging modalities like computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with functional imaging techniques like PET can provide both structural and metabolic information about tumors. This comprehensive approach enables radiologists to better characterize lesions, assess treatment response, and improve patient management decisions by leveraging the strengths of each modality.
