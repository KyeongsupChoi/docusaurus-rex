**CAD (Computer Aided Detection) System:**
CAD refers to computer software algorithms designed to assist radiologists in interpreting medical images, such as X-rays, CT scans, or MRIs. These systems can automatically highlight potential abnormalities or areas of concern in the images, aiding in the detection of diseases or conditions.

**CXR (Chest X-ray Radiographs):**
CXR, or Chest X-ray Radiographs, are medical imaging tests that use X-rays to produce images of the chest area. These images are commonly used to diagnose conditions affecting the lungs, heart, and chest wall, such as pneumonia, tuberculosis, or lung cancer.

**CT (Computed Tomography):**
CT, or Computed Tomography, is a medical imaging technique that uses X-rays and computer processing to create detailed cross-sectional images of the body. CT scans are useful for diagnosing a wide range of conditions, including internal injuries, tumors, and vascular diseases.

**TAT (Turn Around Time) for reports:**
TAT, or Turn Around Time, refers to the period of time it takes for a medical report or diagnostic result to be completed and delivered after the test or examination has been performed. It is an important metric in healthcare settings, as shorter TATs can lead to faster diagnosis and treatment.

**Confusion Matrix:**
A confusion matrix is a table used to evaluate the performance of a classification algorithm. It presents a comparison between the predicted classifications and the actual classifications in a dataset, showing the counts of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.

**Sensitivity:**
Sensitivity is a measure of how well a diagnostic test correctly identifies positive cases out of all actual positive cases. It is calculated as the ratio of true positives to the sum of true positives and false negatives.

**Specificity:**
Specificity is a measure of how well a diagnostic test correctly identifies negative cases out of all actual negative cases. It is calculated as the ratio of true negatives to the sum of true negatives and false positives.

**Confidence Interval:**
A confidence interval is a range of values that is calculated from sample data and is believed to contain the true value of a parameter with a certain level of confidence. It provides a measure of the uncertainty or precision associated with an estimate.

**PPV (Positive Predictive Value):**
PPV, or Positive Predictive Value, is the proportion of true positive results among all positive test results. It indicates the probability that a positive test result truly indicates the presence of the condition being tested for.

**NPV (Negative Predictive Value):**
NPV, or Negative Predictive Value, is the proportion of true negative results among all negative test results. It indicates the probability that a negative test result truly indicates the absence of the condition being tested for.

**ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic):**
ROC, or Receiver Operating Characteristic, is a graphical plot that illustrates the performance of a binary classification model across different threshold settings. It shows the trade-off between sensitivity and specificity for various threshold values.

**AUC (Area Under Curve):**
AUC, or Area Under Curve, is a summary statistic calculated from the ROC curve that represents the overall performance of a binary classification model. It quantifies the model's ability to discriminate between positive and negative cases, with higher values indicating better performance.
