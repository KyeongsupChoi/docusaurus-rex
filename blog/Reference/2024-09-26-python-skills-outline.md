1. Beginner
Skills:
Basic understanding of Python syntax and data structures (lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets).
Ability to write simple programs using variables, loops, conditionals, and functions.
Understanding basic concepts like input/output, string manipulation, and basic error handling.
Limited experience with libraries (e.g., math, random).
Example Tasks:
Writing a program to print Fibonacci numbers.
Simple file handling (e.g., reading and writing text files).
Using loops to iterate over data structures.
2. Intermediate (Here)
Skills:
Deeper understanding of data structures and algorithms.
Familiarity with object-oriented programming (OOP) principles: classes, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation.
Ability to use third-party libraries and frameworks (e.g., Pandas, NumPy, Flask).
Understanding of error handling using exceptions.
Familiarity with modules, packages, and Python's standard library.
Example Tasks:
Writing a web scraper using libraries like BeautifulSoup or Scrapy.
Creating a simple web application using Flask or Django.
Data manipulation and analysis using Pandas and NumPy.
Implementing algorithms like sorting or searching.
3. Advanced
Skills:
Proficient in working with complex data structures (e.g., generators, iterators).
Expert in OOP, design patterns, and advanced Python concepts (e.g., decorators, context managers).
Understanding concurrency and parallelism (using threading, multiprocessing, async/await).
Proficiency in performance optimization (e.g., time complexity, memory usage).
Experience with debugging, testing (unit tests, integration tests), and version control (e.g., Git).
Example Tasks:
Developing a large-scale application with efficient data handling.
Building and maintaining APIs with complex architectures.
Writing unit tests and utilizing continuous integration (CI/CD).
Implementing machine learning models with libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch.
4. Expert
Skills:
Mastery of Python internals, such as memory management, garbage collection, and bytecode.
Ability to contribute to Python core development or design custom libraries and tools.
Deep understanding of multithreading, asynchronous programming, and distributed systems.
Familiarity with low-level programming concepts (e.g., interfacing Python with C/C++).
Knowledge of various domains such as web development, machine learning, automation, data science, and scripting.
Example Tasks:
Designing complex, scalable systems and APIs for production.
Implementing and optimizing large-scale machine learning pipelines.
Contributing to open-source Python projects or writing custom Python extensions.
