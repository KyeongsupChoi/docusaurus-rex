**LLM (Large Language Model):**

LLM refers to a type of artificial intelligence model designed to understand and generate human-like language. 
These models are typically built using deep learning techniques, particularly variants of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) or transformer architectures. 
Examples of LLMs include GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) models developed by OpenAI and BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) developed by Google. 
LLMs have demonstrated impressive capabilities in natural language understanding, text generation, and various language-related tasks.

**Stable Diffusion:**

In the context of machine learning or data analysis, stable diffusion might refer to algorithms or techniques that propagate information or updates through a system in a controlled and stable manner, 
avoiding abrupt changes or instability. This concept may be applied in various domains, including optimization algorithms, signal processing, or network dynamics.

**Vision Transformers:**

Vision Transformers, or ViTs, are a type of neural network architecture designed primarily for visual recognition tasks, such as image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation. 
Unlike traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which rely on convolutional layers to process spatial information, 
Vision Transformers leverage the transformer architecture, originally developed for natural language processing tasks. 
Vision Transformers process images by dividing them into patches, which are then fed into transformer blocks for further processing. 
ViTs have shown promising performance and scalability, particularly for large-scale image datasets.

**Self-supervised Learning:**

Self-supervised learning is a machine learning paradigm where models learn representations from unlabeled data without explicit supervision. 
In self-supervised learning, the model is tasked with predicting certain properties or relationships within the data itself, often by generating auxiliary tasks or objectives. 
These auxiliary tasks typically involve tasks like predicting missing parts of the input, reconstructing the input from corrupted versions, 
or learning to differentiate between different transformations of the input data. 
By learning from unlabeled data in a self-supervised manner, models can acquire meaningful representations that can be transferred to downstream tasks, 
such as classification or regression, with improved performance and generalization.
