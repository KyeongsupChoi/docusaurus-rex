As of today I have 2 years and 2 months of web development experience, and 7 months of ML experience.

And although Changwon is a very affordable city with all the amenities to keep me and my fiance happy, good jobs seem to be nearly impossible to come by.

My current best plan of action is to move to Seoul and work for a decent company that requires a ML engineer, but with my wedding coming up and my fiance requiring an F4 visa for Korea,
Staying put in Changwon until the end of 2023 seems best.
