Artificial Intelligence is an ancient, broad field that can generally be defined as “all
attempts to automate cognitive processes”—in other words, the automation of
thought. This can range from the very basic, such as an Excel spreadsheet, to the very
advanced, like a humanoid robot that can walk and talk.

Machine Learning is a specific subfield of AI that aims at automatically developing
programs (called models) purely from exposure to training data. This process of turning data into a program is called learning. Although machine learning has been
around for a long time, it only started to take off in the 1990s.

Deep learning is one of many branches of machine learning, where the models are
long chains of geometric functions, applied one after the other. These operations are
structured into modules called layers: deep-learning models are typically stacks of layers—or, more generally, graphs of layers. These layers are parameterized by weights,
which are the parameters learned during training. The knowledge of a model is stored
in its weights, and the process of learning consists of finding good values for these
weights.
